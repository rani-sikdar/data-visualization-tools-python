Data visualization is the discipline of trying to understand data by placing it in a visual context so that patterns, trends and correlations that might not otherwise be detected can be exposed. Python offers multiple great graphing libraries that come packed with lots of different features.

The main objective of data visualization is to understand the significance of data and to communicate this information clearly and efficiently. Analyzing and reasoning about data through visualizations makes complex data more accessible, understandable and usable
